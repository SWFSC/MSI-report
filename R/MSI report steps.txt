MSI report steps

why excel for mother file in MSI-data?
* viewability as xslx file in Excel allows word wrapping - timesaver when reviewing many records

(1) Update in SeriousInjuryExtract.r, then run:
* working directory
* data directory
* year range

(2) run AppendixTable.R (ensure in correct directory for Rdata file produced by previous script)

(3) Update in HCM_SI_Report.Rmd, then knit:
* check years are correct
* update Data Availability links

Word doc edits:
* to appendix doc:
  - switch to Landscape orientation
  - fix format by right-clicking on arrow thingy and selecting autofit to contents
  - copy table header from end of main doc and insert as Left Header text applied to all pages, format if needed
  - ensure no blank pages
  - finally convert to PDF (this will take a while) - if get stuck, try printing to PDF?
* to main doc
  - remove TOC because nesting awry and not necessary (or insert page break before Table of Contents (TOC))
  - move author block up to below title from under TOC, delete date, format title page
  - check for rows with zero counts in all Tables and eliminate (ideally by editing HCM_SI_Report.Rmd)
  - manually remove "rowname" from tables 2a-c
  - Table 3-5: fix format by right-clicking on arrow thingy and selecting autofit to contents
  - add thousands-place commas if missing
  - left-click Table of Contents header, select update table -> 'Update entire table'
  - delete Appendix 1 placeholder page
  - any other formatting
  - ensure no blank pages
  - finally convert to PDF

Clean up
* copy 5-year and all-time CSVs to MSI-data repo, commit, and push
