MSI report steps

(1) Update the following in SeriousInjuryExtract.r, then run:
* working directory
* data directory
* year range

(2) run AppendixTable.R (ensure working directory or path is where Rdata file was created by previous script)

(3) HCM_SI_Report.Rmd
* check years are correct
* update Data Availability link for 5-year data
* fix italicization of species names in references as needed
* knit

(4) Clean up
* copy 5-year and all-time CSVs to MSI-report/data folder if not written there directly
* commit and push changes to scripts and data files in MSI-report repo

(5) Word doc edits:
* to appendix doc:
  - switch to Landscape orientation
  - fix format by right-clicking on arrow thingy and selecting autofit to contents
  - copy table header from end of main doc and insert as Left Header text applied to all pages, format if needed
  - ensure no blank pages
  - finally *print* to PDF (converting with Acrobat typically gets stuck, OK for table not to be 508 compliant)
* to main doc
  - remove TOC because nesting awry and not necessary (or insert page break before Table of Contents (TOC))
  - delete/update date, format title page
  - check for rows with zero counts in all Tables and eliminate (ideally by editing HCM_SI_Report.Rmd)
  - check for "n=0" in text summaries and eliminate where appropriate.
  - manually remove "rowname" from tables 2a-c
  - Table 3-5: fix format by right-clicking on arrow thingy and selecting autofit to contents
  - add thousands-place commas where missing
  - delete Appendix 1 placeholder page
  - any other formatting
  - ensure no blank pages
  - finally convert to PDF
* combine these two documents with Acrobat and make 508 compliant
  - see below for example text for populating Document Properties

(6) After publication to SWFSC
* update README, version release for this repo
* email distribution list (can this be set up as GitHub Action with release?): Jeff, Alex, Justin Greenman - NOAA Federal <justin.greenman@noaa.gov>, Kristin Wilkinson - NOAA Federal <kristin.wilkinson@noaa.gov>, Lauren Saez - NOAA Affiliate <lauren.saez@noaa.gov>, Dan Lawson - NOAA Federal <dan.lawson@noaa.gov>, Justin Viezbicke - NOAA Federal <justin.viezbicke@noaa.gov>, Hanna Miller, Meghan Roberts, ...
