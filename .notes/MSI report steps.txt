MSI report steps

(1) Update the following in SeriousInjuryExtract.r, then run:
* working directory
* data directory
* year range

(2) run AppendixTable.R (ensure in correct directory for Rdata file produced by previous script)

(3) Update in HCM_SI_Report.Rmd, then knit:
* check years are correct
* update Data Availability link for 5-year data

Word doc edits:
* to appendix doc:
  - switch to Landscape orientation
  - fix format by right-clicking on arrow thingy and selecting autofit to contents
  - copy table header from end of main doc and insert as Left Header text applied to all pages, format if needed
  - ensure no blank pages
  - finally *print* to PDF (converting with Acrobat typically gets stuck, OK for table not to be 508 compliant)
* to main doc
  - remove TOC because nesting awry and not necessary (or insert page break before Table of Contents (TOC))
  - delete/update date, format title page
  - check for rows with zero counts in all Tables and eliminate (ideally by editing HCM_SI_Report.Rmd)
  - check for "n=0" in text summaries and eliminate where appropriate.
  - manually remove "rowname" from tables 2a-c
  - Table 3-5: fix format by right-clicking on arrow thingy and selecting autofit to contents
  - add thousands-place commas if missing
  - check for italicization of species names in references
  - delete Appendix 1 placeholder page
  - any other formatting
  - ensure no blank pages
  - finally convert to PDF
* combine these two documents with Acrobat and make 508 compliant
  - can use text below to aid in populating document properties
