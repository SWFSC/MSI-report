* additional changes suggested by Jim, e.g. for what to include in "systematic"
* change title: "U.S. West Coast Pacific"?
* remove appendix 1? Karin F prefers to keep A1, but now a 508 nightmare
  - ask IR directly if tables have to 508-compliant now as Steph F states? Jim was told by IR directly they do not, which Kit did not know.
  - id drop: add note in data availability pointing to supp material, provide csv with pdf to IR? or just point to files in repo?
  - or able to fix conversion issue to pdf for Appendix 1? (font?)
* improve automation of formatting and 508 
  - css file available for TMs that can add in?
  - https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/ResourceBook/content/508_compliance.html
  - convert to Quarto?
  - does 'gt' package for tables help anything?
* SeriousInjuryExtract as a function that takes a working directory, year range
* can table-writing functionality be further packaged into functions so easier to adapt and read?
* silence NA read warnings in read_excel for SeriousInjuryPackage
* reorg the creation of many other products from this code
* set up to access data directly from web? or makes sense for MSI-data to be cloned already so can populate with CSVs
* set up GitHub Action for emailing distribution list upon version release?
* set up as releases: SRG draft for review, final annual report
* publish html to POSIT Connect for limited (SRG) review?
* potentially no longer include Table 1 (or other tables?) - see reports from other regions
* Hanna and Meghan: consider a landing page for the MSI reports for our region


* future main file format and location? 
  Considerations:
   - ease of reading/editing -> Sheets or Excel
   - system that encourages keeping it updated among frequent users
   - Read access needed for collaborators across NOAA, some without GH accounts
   - Data validation is built into Excel file (and appears to import well to a Google Sheets file too)
   - versioning (ideally with changes clearly shown)
     ~ details of versions not available when replace xlsx in GH or GDrive. 
     ~ CSV has character conversion issues and is not as easy to edit
     ~ Edits also relatively easy via version history to see IFF made directly to file on GDrive (true for XLSX and Sheets)
   - Excel that is downloaded and reuploaded allows data re-sorting without saving, but this can be overcome 
    if working directly on GDrive by reverting to a previous version, as long as no edits made
   - GHE is gold standard backed up (i.e., backed up somewhere routinely through no action on our part), but not archival FWIW
   - Resolution and levels of sharing on Google Shared Drive not amenable to need to share single file for read access with NOAA collabs. Could request separate shared drive for that file, and add shortcut in CMAP shared drive? Or make it a CMAP shared drive file and then copy over to somewhere public when ready to share. 
   - advantage of keeping internal is allows keeping spatial info and stripping only for public share version
